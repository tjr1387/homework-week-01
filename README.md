# Week 1 Homework Challenge -- Refactoring Horiseon

## Description

The intention of this repo is to take an already functional static webpage for a sample company (in this case, 'Horiseon') and refactor it to accomplish three primary things: use semantic HTML elements, make accessible image elements and consolidate the CSS (reducing redundancies and reflecting the HTML element improvements) with some apt and organizational commentary.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The page functions the same as it did before -- simply displaying some basic information about this company in a pleasant layout. The three links in the header will jump down to their respective categories' content.

Screenshots: Two versions (differing widths) contained within '/assets/my-mockup' folder.
